# Bachelor thesis python scripts
The scripts I wrote for the data analysis in my bachelor thesis.

Includes:  
- the scripts to create CMDs for the three datasets I used  
- the script to analyse the crossmatches carried out for those datasets  
- the script to list the WD candidates and their properties  
- the scripts for the log(g) and T_eff comparisons  
- the scripts to plot spectra from the FITS files  
- the script for transforming coordinates from degree to hours

The datasets referenced in the scripts are not provided here.
